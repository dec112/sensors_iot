This repository provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring IoT devices, with this part describing the ESP32 BLE/WiFi Gateway. With this software, users can integrate sensors (Puck.js) and monitor the status, performance, and any anomalies. The system continuously collects data from the connected devices and analyzes it to determine if they are functioning correctly or if potential problems might arise. Upon detecting unusual activities or when device parameters fall outside the established normal range, alarms are immediately triggered. These alerts can be relayed through various channels such as email, or alerting through the DEC112 ESInet. The repository includes both the code for data collection and analysis, as well as a user-friendly interface for configuring monitoring settings and alarm conditions. The aim of this project is to provide a robust and scalable solution to ensure the efficiency and security of IoT networks. The current repository includes the ESP32 BLE/WiFi Gateway as shown in the figure below.

## Developer Information

### ESP32-HW

We recommend the following hardware for this project: [ESP32 NodeMCU](https://www.berrybase.at/esp32-nodemcu-development-board?c=2473)

### IDE

The ESP32 BLE/WiFi Gateway was created with [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/) and VS Code (alternatively, [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) can also be used). Besides the platform 'espressif32', the board 'nodemcu-32s' and the 'arduino' framework, no further libraries are necessary. The following additions are required:

- to support MAC in Notfiy callback, following changes are required in

_BLERemoteCharacteristic.h_
`````
~/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoespressif32/libraries/BLE/src/BLERemoteCharacteristic.h
`````

line 25: add <em>esp_bd_addr_t addr,</em>

`````
typedef std::function<void(BLERemoteCharacteristic* pBLERemoteCharacteristic, esp_bd_addr_t addr, uint8_t* pData, size_t length, bool isNotify)> notify_callback;
`````

_BLERemoteCharacteristic.cpp_

`````
~/..platformio/packages/framework-arduinoespressif32/libraries/BLE/src/BLERemoteCharacteristic.cpp
`````

line 166: add <em>evtParam->notify.remote_bda,</em>

`````
m_notifyCallback(this, evtParam->notify.remote_bda, evtParam->notify.value, evtParam->notify.value_len, evtParam->notify.is_notify);
`````

- Callback example

just add <em>BLEAddress BLEAddr,</em> as shown below

`````
static void notifyButtonCallback(BLERemoteCharacteristic* pBLERemoteCharacteristic, BLEAddress BLEAddr, uint8_t* pData, size_t length, bool isNotify)
...
  Serial.printf(" ADDR[%s] ", BLEAddr.toString().c_str());
...
`````
- platformio.ini

`````
[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = nodemcu-32s
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 115200
upload_port = /dev/ttyUSB*
board_build.partitions = no_ota.csv
lib_deps = hieromon/AutoConnect@^1.4.2
`````

### ESP32-SW

Two files in the project are sufficient to enable all functions of the ESP32 BLE/Wifi GW:
- **json.h**: is an integrated library to provide essential JSON functionality for the project. The library was supplemented by the _jsonb_float()_ function.
- **main.cpp**: includes ESP32 setup and loop functions as well as callback and help functions for operating the GW

Since a connection can be initiated with any BLE device, we filter our devices (Puck.js) based on their MAC addresses (According to the standard, a maximum of 4 devices can be connected). For further details how to configure the ESP32 via a captive portal refer to _User Information_ below.

## User Information

### Captive Portal

The first step is to select the ESP32 WiFi (ssid: esp32ap; password: 12345678) on the laptop or mobile device. Depending on the operating system, you will be prompted to log in to the portal (login page), see the figures below:

<img align="center" src="images/cp_select_nw_browser.png" height="20">

<br>

<img align="center" src="images/cp_select_nw.png" height="50">

<br>

After successful login the following page appears:

<img align="center" src="images/cp_default_home.png" height="250">

<br>

Use the _Configure new AP_ menu to select a local WiFi from the list (to specify a static IP address, clear the _Enable DHCP_ checkbox.) and log in with the local password, as shown below:

<img align="center" src="images/cp_select_ap.png" height="250">

<br>

The following page is shown during the configuration:

<img align="center" src="images/cp_wait_ap.png" height="250">

<br>

If the new WiFi has been successfully configured, the following information page is displayed. The line with the IP address is important - copy this address and create the following URL: _http://\<ip-addr\>/dec4iot_; in the example shown, this is _http://10.0.0.96/dec4iot_

<img align="center" src="images/cp_done_ap.png" height="250">

<br>

### MAC Address Filter

Now you can switch to the local network (_Established Connection_) to configure the local time zone and the MAC addresses (puck.js)

<img align="center" src="images/cp_config_mac.png" height="250">

<br>

After clicking the Save button, the following page will appear after successful saving. From now on, the system searches for configured puck.js and establishes a BLE connection if necessary (i.e. if the MAC address matches).

<img align="center" src="images/cp_saved_mac.png" height="250">

<br>

## Issues

The current version does not save configured puck.js MAC addresses permanently, i.e. they must be reconfigured after a restart of the ESP32. The last selected WiFi remains saved.
