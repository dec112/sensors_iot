## User Information

Once you have your Bangle.JS set up with dec4IoT, you will be able to send emergency messages from Bangle.JS.

To send emergency messages from your Bangle.JS, open the App from your App Loader and either the side button or the "SOS" button on the screen.

### User Deployment
* Use a version of the [App-Loader](https://github.com/jkdev-io/BangleApps), which already has the app uploaded.


## Developer Information

### Guidelines
Do **not** change the variable/function names for [`startSetupIntent`](https://github.com/jkdev-io/BangleApps/blob/master/apps/dec4iot/app.js#L65C7-L65C23), [`sendDataIntent()`](https://github.com/jkdev-io/BangleApps/blob/master/apps/dec4iot/app.js#L66C7-L66C21) and [`startLogic()`](https://github.com/jkdev-io/BangleApps/blob/master/apps/dec4iot/app.js#L67C10-L67C20). They are used by the Android app.

### Developer Deployment
1. Setup a Bangle.Js Development environment

   First, fork the [`espruino/BangleApps`](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps) repository. [Setup Github Pages](https://espruino.com/Bangle.js+App+Loader#enable-github-pages). Copy the `dec4iot` folder into the `apps` folder in the forked repository. Now open your favourite code editor and do as you please.

2. Upload the Code onto Bangle.Js

   Push your code and wait for the Pages Build to finish. After, open the Github Pages URL. Connect to your device and upload the app.
   **You will likely find a more updated version of this app at [`jkdev-io/BangleApps`](https://github.com/jkdev-io/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/dec4iot). Please copy the files from there!**
