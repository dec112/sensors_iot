To continue developing the Bangle.Js Application, follow these steps:

1. Setup the Bangle.Js Development environment

    First, fork the [`espruino/BangleApps`](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps) repository. [Setup Github Pages](https://espruino.com/Bangle.js+App+Loader#enable-github-pages). Copy the `dec4iot` folder into the `apps` folder in the forked repository. Now open your favourite code editor and do as you please.

2. Upload the Code onto Bangle.Js

    Push your code and wait for the Pages Build to finish. After, open the Github Pages URL. Connect to your device and upload the app.

### You will likely find a more updated version of this app at [jkdev-io/BangleApps](https://github.com/jkdev-io/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/dec4iot). Please copy the files from there!
