## Developer Information

### Guidelines
Do **not** change the function names for [`discovery()`](https://github.com/dec112/sensors_iot/blob/main/puck-js/puck_js-latest.js#L83C10-L83C19), [`discovered()`](https://github.com/dec112/sensors_iot/blob/main/puck-js/puck_js-latest.js#L96C10-L96C20) and [`writeConfig()`](https://github.com/dec112/sensors_iot/blob/main/puck-js/puck_js-latest.js#L66C10-L66C21). They are used by the Onboarding app for setup of the Puck.JS's config.
